## Description

A web application that will predict future rating of a user-specied Television show or Movie. The end goal is to train an ML model on a large number of time series to help users determine if their favourite shows will remain relevant in the near future

## Installation and usage

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Verel site

I have deployed a prototype of the application on Vercel. Currently, the app's functionality includes providing brief details on a user-specified movie/tv show. Future plan include displaying graph data that displays forcasted ratings. Here is the website link: https://tvnostradamus.vercel.app/

Let me know if you have any questions on the app! I am happy to receive feeback or any suggestions!
